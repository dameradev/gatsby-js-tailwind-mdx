> Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
> It gives you a bunch of css classes that have a certain goal, for example adding class .flex adds `display:flex` to the element

<div class="flex flex-col">
  <h2 class="text-3xl">Why I like tailwind</h2>
  <ul class="list-decimal">
    <li>More control over styling then other CSS frameworks</li>
    <li>It makes me way faster when writing html/css code</li>
    <li>Responsiveness and Security </li>
    <li>
      You get <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">fully automatic</span>{" "}
      critical CSS extraction and code splitting
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Code for the above example

```html
<div class="flex flex-col">
  <h2 class="text-3xl">Why I like tailwind</h2>
  <ul class="list-decimal">
    <li>More control over styling then other CSS frameworks</li>
    <li>It makes me way faster when writing html/css code</li>
    <li>Responsiveness and Security</li>
    <li>
      You get <span class="font-bold text-blue-600">fully automatic</span>{" "}
      critical CSS extraction and code splitting
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

As you can see I was able to style
this div without using a single line of CSS,
if you're proficient in CSS you should be able to
understand what these classes do.
